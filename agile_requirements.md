# Agile Requirements for GiggleGit

# Theme:
Get GiggleGit demo into a stable enough alpha to start onboarding some adventurous clients.

# Epic:
Onboarding experience.

# User Story 1:
As a vanilla Git power-user, I want to quickly understand how to use GiggleGit without needing to reference a lot of documentation, so that I can start using it right away.

# User Story 2:
As a team lead onboarding an experienced GiggleGit user, I want to be able to add new team members to GiggleGit by importing their existing git preferences, so that they can immediately start working in the environment they are comfortable with.

# User Story 3:
As a new user joining the team, I want to see example projects that show how GiggleGit works, so I can quickly understand its features and start using it right away.

# Task:
- Provide access to example repositories for new users

# Ticket 1: Create sample repositories with guided instructions
  - Details: Make sample repositories with common tasks like merging, resolving conflicts, and using memes to show off GiggleGit's features. Add easy-to-follow instructions for users.

# Ticket 2: Build a guide for first time users
  - Details: Create a step-by-step guide for new users that walks them through their first project in GiggleGit. The guide should be easy to follow with visual aids and simple language.


# Task 3:
This is not a valid user story because it lacks context about the "why" of the user's need. This statement is more of a requirement or a feature request, since it describes a function without providing the reasoning behind it.
